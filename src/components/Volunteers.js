      <h3>Join the Team</h3>

      <p>At Huellitas, every life matters, and every act of kindness counts. There&apos;s  always room for more helping hands and caring hearts. There are many ways to collaborate, and all help is welcomed with open arms.</p>
      <p>Come visit us and meet the animals eagerly waiting to become part of a loving family. Together, we can make a difference in the lives of these precious souls, one paw at a time. Join us on our mission to ensure that every animal experiences the warmth and comfort of a forever home.</p>

      <h3>Foster Homes</h3>

      <p>Every day, we rescue litters of puppies and injured animals in need of special care. We&apos;re looking for volunteers to welcome them into their homes, providing them with love and affection until they&apos;re ready to be vaccinated and transferred to the center. Similarly, operated dogs and cats or those who have suffered abuse require calm homes for their recovery. It&apos;s important that someone cares for them and observes their progress. There are also older animals who long for love and comfort in their twilight years.</p>

      <h3>Dog Walkers</h3>

      <p> <span>Take the leash and leave pawprints.</span>  Do you want to be part of Huellitas&apos;magic? Become a walker for our adorable rescued dogs. Enjoy the company of these furry friends as you explore the surroundings of our shelter.</p>
      <p>Every step you take with them not only provides them with exercise and mental stimulation but also helps them socialize and prepare for finding a loving home. As a walker, you have the opportunity to make a significant difference in the lives of these animals by providing them with individualized attention and unconditional love. Join us as a walker!</p>
